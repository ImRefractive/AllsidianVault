Chapter 1
	Absolutely. In the opening chapter of "Heart of Darkness," Marlow narrates his experience aboard a French warship anchored on the Thames. The scene is gloomy, with a sense of foreboding hanging in the air. The ship, undergoing repairs, becomes a symbol of the larger theme of decay and corruption that Marlow will encounter in the African wilderness.
	As Marlow waits for the tide to rise, he observes the various people on the ship, including the crew and officials. He reflects on the nature of imperialism and the idea of European nations venturing into the unknown heart of Africa. This introspection sets the tone for the exploration of the darkness within human nature and the consequences of colonialism.
	Marlow's narration is retrospective, adding a layer of reflection and contemplation. The chapter serves as an introduction, providing glimpses of the major themes that will unfold as Marlow delves deeper into the African continent. The imagery and atmosphere created in this chapter lay the foundation for the psychological and moral challenges that will characterise the journey ahead.
