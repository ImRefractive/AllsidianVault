identity is a representation of someones nationality and culture and the way that other people perceive others is directly based on the identity they show to to the world, i cant think of anything else, it seems pretty cut and dry in my opinion. people's identities are multi faceted, and they choose which parts to show to any given group of people based on their previous experiences with said group of people. just as identity is built by someones culture, culture is a combination of many generations of identities and ideas, and the best representation of these varying identities are community driven holidays, and generally places or activities that bring people of a community together.
