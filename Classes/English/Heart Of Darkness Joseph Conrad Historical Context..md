Language: What languages did Conrad speak and why? What impact did they have on his work and life?   
	He spoke Polish, English, and French. Polish because it is his mother tongue, French because he went sailing in Marseille with a french merchant service. Conrad only learned English in his early 20s. 
Merchant Marine: What led to Conrad’s interest in sailing? What were his experiences with the MM?  
	After landing in Marseille, he apparently grew to love the Mediterranean. He also apparently never learned how to swim. He first went on his first sea voyage as a passenger, a month later he went on his second voyage as an apprentice. He then went on a seven month long voyage, before taking six months off the sea. On one of his next voyages he met a Corsican first mate who he later used as inspiration for one of his novels. Later on in his maritime life, he was no longer allowed to sail on French ships without permissions of the Russians, who wouldn't give it because he needed to serve in the Russian Army. He then conversed with his uncle on what to do and eventually decided on joining the English Merchant Marine as they would not need to get Russian Permission.
