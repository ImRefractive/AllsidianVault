### Supreme court 
	Roosevelt had flexible thoughts about the constitution, and the Supreme court, the guardian of the constitution did not take kindly. 
	During Roosevelts election campaign he did not directly attack the supreme court, but showed concern about its inner workings and thought it to be in need of reform. 
	Although the supreme court had shown its support for Roosevelt during the workings of the new deal, after Roosevelts first term ended, they declared the legislations he passed as unconstitutional. To show how much the Supreme court disliked Roosevelt, the prior 140 years had naught but 60 laws declared uncostitutional, and during the next 18 months between 1935-1936 it declared 11 more to be so. 
	On one specific day called "Black Monday" The supreme court attacked the New deal in several ways, for example, it called the "Farm mortage act" unconstitutional, stating that what it sought to do was not the right of the president but rather of the congress 
	The sick chicken case. 
		Possibly the most serious decision by the Supreme Court, which motivated Roosevelt to take action. The case revolved around New York butchers selling chicken meat unfit for human consumption, the butchers were consequently prosecuted by NIRA, after which they appealed to the supreme court, and the supreme court ruled in their favour, effectively stating that the federal government had no right to interfere with any internal state issues. This meant that by extension all the NIRA codes were unconstitutional as they were developed by the federal government yet interfered with the judgement of individual states. 
		The arguments of the supreme courts followed along the lines that what the executive power had done was in it of itself unconstitutional, as they gave themselves the right to interfere in matters that should be under the jurisdiction of individual states.
		The ruling seemed to imply that the government had no rights to interfere in nation wide economic affairs except if they affected inter state commerce. 
	Failure of the Judicial Reform Bill
		The whole thing backfired, Roosevelt "Stirred up a hornets nest" Roosevelt also greatly underestimated public support for the courts and fears from the judicials that he would retire them at 70 next, in light of this, Roosevelt was seen as a dictator, leading to the rejecting of the bill with 70-20 split for votes. However, it was not a total defeat for Roosevelt as: 
		- Justice Van Devanter, who was ill at the time, retired
		- The supreme court recognized Roosevelt's massive win in the election and began to uphold the legislation he proposed such as the National Labour Relations, and Social Security Act. 
		- As more Justices reitred, Roosevelt could appoint his supporters to their roles. 
	Summary 
	Roosevelt's relationship with the Supreme Court became strained as it declared numerous New Deal legislations unconstitutional, culminating in the significant "Black Monday" decision. The Sick Chicken Case underscored the Court's stance on limiting federal intervention in state affairs, questioning the constitutionality of NIRA codes. This precedent set by the case suggested that the federal government lacked the authority to interfere in nationwide economic issues unless they directly affected interstate commerce. Roosevelt's Judicial Reform Bill aimed to reshape the Court but faced public and judicial opposition, leading to its rejection. Despite this setback, some justices retired, and the Court gradually shifted its stance, eventually upholding Roosevelt's key legislations. This marked a complex period of constitutional conflict and political maneuvering during Roosevelt's presidency.
### Agriculture and the dust bowl
	All
		Roosevelt suffered further problems with agriculture and rural poverty, only exacerbated by the problems with the AAA (Agricultural adjustment act), and the natural disaster that was the Dustbowl, all of this in conjunction lead to the biggest migration in US history, which came with many problems that the government had to deal with. 
	AAA
		The Agricultural Adjustment Act was generally considered sucessfull. However, various problems emerged as time went on.
