### Supreme court 
	Why did this happen?
		Roosevelt had flexible thoughts about the constitution, and the Supreme court, the guardian of the constitution did not take kindly. 
		During Roosevelts election campaign he did not directly attack the supreme court, but showed concern about its inner workings and thought it to be in need of reform. 
	Supreme court backlash
		Although the supreme court had shown its support for Roosevelt during the workings of the new deal, after Roosevelts first term ended, they declared the legislations he passed as unconstitutional. To show how much the Supreme court disliked Roosevelt, the prior 140 years had naught but 60 laws declared uncostitutional, and during the next 18 months between 1935-1936 it declared 11 more to be so. 
		On one specific day called "Black Monday" The supreme court attacked the New deal in several ways, for example, it called the "Farm mortage act" unconstitutional, stating that what it sought to do was not the right of the president but rather of the congress 
	The sick chicken case. 
		Possibly the most serious decision by the Supreme Court, which motivated Roosevelt to take action. The case revolved around New York butchers selling chicken meat unfit for human consumption, the butchers were consequently prosecuted by NIRA, after which they appealed to the supreme court, and the supreme court ruled in their favour, effectively stating that the federal government had no right to interfere with any internal state issues. This meant that by extension all the NIRA codes were unconstitutional as they were developed by the federal government yet interfered with the judgement of individual states. 
		The arguments of the supreme courts followed along the lines that what the executive power had done was in it of itself unconstitutional, as they gave themselves the right to interfere in matters that should be under the jurisdiction of individual states.
		The ruling seemed to imply that the government had no rights to interfere in nation wide economic affairs except if they affected inter state commerce. 
	Failure of the Judicial Reform Bill
		The whole thing backfired, Roosevelt "Stirred up a hornets nest" Roosevelt also greatly underestimated public support for the courts and fears from the judicials that he would retire them at 70 next, in light of this, Roosevelt was seen as a dictator, leading to the rejecting of the bill with 70-20 split for votes. However, it was not a total defeat for Roosevelt as: 
		- Justice Van Devanter, who was ill at the time, retired
		- The supreme court recognized Roosevelt's massive win in the election and began to uphold the legislation he proposed such as the National Labour Relations, and Social Security Act. 
		- As more Justices reitred, Roosevelt could appoint his supporters to their roles. 
	Summary 
		Roosevelt's relationship with the Supreme Court became strained as it declared numerous New Deal legislations unconstitutional, culminating in the significant "Black Monday" decision. The Sick Chicken Case underscored the Court's stance on limiting federal intervention in state affairs, questioning the constitutionality of NIRA codes. This precedent set by the case suggested that the federal government lacked the authority to interfere in nationwide economic issues unless they directly affected interstate commerce. Roosevelt's Judicial Reform Bill aimed to reshape the Court but faced public and judicial opposition, leading to its rejection. Despite this setback, some justices retired, and the Court gradually shifted its stance, eventually upholding Roosevelt's key legislations. This marked a complex period of constitutional conflict and political maneuvering during Roosevelt's presidency.
### Agriculture and the dust bowl
	All
		Roosevelt suffered further problems with agriculture and rural poverty, only exacerbated by the problems with the AAA (Agricultural adjustment act), and the natural disaster that was the Dustbowl, all of this in conjunction lead to the biggest migration in US history, which came with many problems that the government had to deal with. 
	AAA
		The Agricultural Adjustment Act was generally considered sucessfull. However, various problems emerged as time went on. 
		The AAA was ran by country committees, and therefore tended to be dominated by the most powerful landowners, leading to an incresing feeling that the AAA only benefitted the wealthy. 
		Although farm income doubled during the 1930s it still only reached around 80% of the income farmers were making prior to 1914, meaning that the agricultural sector was still mostly depressed economically
	The DustBowl
		The dustbowl was a natural catastrope that took place around much of rural America, it was caused by years of over-ploughing the land in the agricultural regions, which left the soil fine and prone to being blown around by the wind. This problem was usually counteracted by the years of heavy rain, but during dry years with high wind speeds, the soil was literally being blown away. In particular, during the 1930s the US suffered from a series of droughts that left the soil suceptible to being blown by the wind, which in 1934 lead to 35 million acres of previously arable land being destroyed, while the soul of 125 million acres was "Exhausted". Chicago, for example received 1.8kg of soil for every one of its citizens.
		Effects 
			Entire landscapes were covered in dust, with days being dark as night due to swirling masses of dust brought by the wind in the sky. Entire homes were buried, former crop land was blown all the way to the rock layer, thousands lost their farms and were forced to migrate, leading to an increase in unemployment rates in southern states such as Arkansas which had a 39% unemployment rate.
			California did not let people migrate and expelled many immigrants.
		Government Measures
			They set up the Soil Erosion Service in august 1933, later renamed the Soil Conservation Service and became part of the department of agriculture. 
			The SCS(Soil Conservation Service) divided farms into soil conservation districts and encouraged farmers to consider enw ideas such as contour ploughing to hold the soil. 
			The CCC planted trees and shelter-beds, yet it all proved to be too little and too late, as when farmers reclaimed their land they often began to over-plough again which lead to the Dustbowl returning in some areas
		Floods
			When the rain finally did come back, they would not stop, on Jan 23, 1937, the NYT(New York Times) reported that floods across 12 states had make 150k people homeless, and lead to the death of nearly 4000.
		Long term effects
			These events were disastrous in the short term, yet ultimately beneficial for American Agriculture. Many of the surplus workfoce left and the remaining farms became bigger and more efficient. by 1933 it was estimated 1 in every 10 farms changed hands and that half those sales were forced.
	Summary
		Roosevelt faced challenges in agriculture and rural poverty, exacerbated by issues with the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) and the natural disaster known as the Dust Bowl. The AAA, while initially successful, was criticized for benefiting wealthy landowners and leaving the agricultural sector economically depressed. The Dust Bowl, caused by over-ploughing and exacerbated by droughts, led to the destruction of arable land and forced a massive migration, particularly affecting southern states like Arkansas.
		The Dust Bowl's effects were devastating, with landscapes covered in dust, homes buried, and widespread unemployment. California, facing an influx of migrants, expelled many immigrants. Government measures, including the Soil Conservation Service and the Civilian Conservation Corps, aimed to mitigate soil erosion and environmental damage. However, these efforts proved insufficient as some areas experienced a recurrence of the Dust Bowl.
		Floods further compounded the challenges, causing homelessness and fatalities. Despite the short-term disasters, these events prompted changes in American agriculture. The migration resulted in a more efficient agricultural sector, with a significant number of farms changing hands, albeit often under forced circumstances, leading to larger and more efficient farms by 1933.
### Industry and labor tensions
	Labor relations
		Labor Unions wanted to exercise their rights given to them by the Wagner Act and NIRA. However many employers did not recognize those, It was often these strikes would result in violence, one famous example being the "Memorial Day Massacre"
		Memorial Day Massacre
			The dispute began when Republic Steel refused to recognize trade unions, leading to protesters marching on the mill, the Chicago police promptly fired into the unarmed crowd, killing 10 and wounding 30, some of whom were permanently disabled. No policemen were prosecuted for these deaths or injuries.
	Creation of the Comittee of Industrial Organizations
		The AFL (American Federation of Labor) favoured craft unions and did not encourage semi-skilled and unskilled workers to unionized. John Lewis, the president of the United Mine Workers, in particular, wanted to see larger industry wide unions rather than smaller singular based ones. The AFL showed little to no interest which later on caused Lewis and others who had similar thoughts to break off of the group and form the Congress of Industrial Organizations. (CIO)
	The CIO
		The CIO achieved union ercognition in the automobile, steel, rubbber, electricity, textile, and farm industries by the end of 1937. Union membership rose from four million to seven million by 1937. The number of strikes rose from 637 in 1930 to 2172 in 1936. Managers of big companies were worried about the threats to their profits, while The unions were concerned about the levels of violence used against their portesters, which was often condoned by the authorities.
	Roosevelt's involvement
		Both sides (Unions and the companies) looked towards Roosevelt to help, but he did nothing, gaining both their ire. Roosevelt felt that both sides had to solve their own problems, Roosevelt was not sympathetic to labour inions, as hardly any of the New Deal legislations relating to them was ever initialized by him. However, as the unions grew in strength he could no longer afford to ignore them, as by 1940 they made the largest contribution to the democratic party's campaign funds.
	Summary
		Labor tensions during this period were marked by conflicts between unions, seeking to exercise their rights under the Wagner Act and NIRA, and employers who often resisted recognition. The Memorial Day Massacre, a notorious incident, occurred when Republic Steel refused to recognize trade unions, leading to a violent confrontation where Chicago police fired into an unarmed crowd, resulting in 10 deaths and 30 injuries. No policemen faced prosecution for these actions.
		The Committee of Industrial Organizations (CIO) emerged as a response to the American Federation of Labor's (AFL) preference for craft unions. Led by John Lewis, the CIO advocated for larger industry-wide unions, gaining recognition in various industries by 1937 and increasing union membership from four million to seven million by 1937. The number of strikes surged from 637 in 1930 to 2172 in 1936, causing concern among company managers about potential profit threats and escalating violence condoned by authorities.
		While both unions and companies looked to Roosevelt for intervention, he initially remained uninvolved, earning dissatisfaction from both sides. Roosevelt, not initially sympathetic to labor unions, believed they should solve their own problems. However, as unions grew in strength and contributed significantly to the Democratic Party's campaign funds by 1940, Roosevelt could no longer afford to ignore their influence.
### Wider economic recovery & the Roosevelt recession 
	Roosevelt Recession
		in 1937 he cut the Federal expenditure budget to meet Roosevelt's belief in a balanced budged. He had hoped that business had recovered enough to fill the gaps left by the cutback. They had not. These cutbacks lead to what was called the Roosevelt Recession. Unemployment rose, particularly among farm workers, with the numbers rising from 7 million to just under 10 million 400 thousand in just 12 months. This made it so social security payments alone cost 2 billion dollars worth of the nation's wealth.
		In the manufacturing industries employment fell by 23%.
		Overall nation income fell by 13%.
		66% of the gains made during the New Deal years were lost.
		Fall in Index was faster than at any time during the earlier depression.
	Big Business
		Big business was made a scapegoat for the colapse, the TNEC (Temporary National Economic Commitee) was speedily set up to investigate price fixing among larger corporations. Many government officials thought these practices were responsible for the recession. 
		Didnt matter because people realized that although they felt bad for small businesses, big business could provide relatively cheap, mass-produced goods that small companies couldn't.
	Roosevelt's attempts at unfucking shit up
		Roosevelt caved and returned to deficit spending, asking Congress to vote him 3.8 Billion relief budget, with most of it going to the PWA and WPA
		Recovery was slow, and in 1939 unemployment still stood at 9 million. Roosevelt was slowly moving towards more government intervention in the economy and deficit spending, but the change was slow and reluctant. By the late 1930s the european war began to shape Roosevelt's policies, and he seemed to give more support to those adviers such as Harry Hopskins and Frances Perkins who had advocated for more government involvement, leading to conservative Democrats being increasingly frozen out.
	Summary
		In 1937, Roosevelt's decision to cut the federal expenditure budget, aiming for a balanced budget, led to the Roosevelt Recession. This contraction caused a significant rise in unemployment, particularly among farm workers, resulting in a loss of 66% of the gains made during the New Deal years. The manufacturing industry saw a 23% decline in employment, and the nation's overall income fell by 13%. Social security payments alone cost 2 billion dollars of the nation's wealth.
		Big business became a scapegoat for the economic collapse, prompting the establishment of the Temporary National Economic Committee (TNEC) to investigate price fixing among larger corporations. Despite criticism, people recognized the efficiency of big businesses in providing relatively cheap, mass-produced goods.
		To address the economic downturn, Roosevelt returned to deficit spending, requesting a 3.8 billion relief budget from Congress, with a significant portion allocated to the Public Works Administration (PWA) and Works Progress Administration (WPA). Despite these efforts, recovery was slow, and unemployment remained at 9 million in 1939. Roosevelt's approach began shifting towards more government intervention and deficit spending, influenced by advisors advocating for increased government involvement. The outbreak of the European war further shaped Roosevelt's policies, leading to the marginalization of conservative Democrats in favor of those supporting greater government intervention in the economy.
