Charle's law
	V ‚àù T
Boyle's Law
	P1.V1 = P2V2
Ideal Gas Law
	PV = nRT
	P is pressure 
	V is volume 
	n is moles 
	T is temperature in Kelvin
	R is the universal gas law constant
	Assumptions
		Fills the entire space
		No intermolecular forces (Attraction)
			Basically means that a gas at low temperature and high pressure will not liquify/solidify
Combined Gas law 
	w
STP
	0C 
	100kPa
	1 mole of an ideal gas gives you 22.7L of gas
