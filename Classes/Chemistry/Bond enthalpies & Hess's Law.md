## Bond Enthalpy (BE) 
Is defined as the energy required to break one mole of bonds by homolytic fission in one mole of gaseous covalent molecules under standard conditions.

Homolytic is when the electrons from the bond are split equally.

* Breaking bonds requires energy $\Delta H$ Is positive, endothermic
* Bond making releases enegy $\Delta H$ Is negative, exothermic

Always products - reactants. 

Hess's law: energy released required by a reaction is independent of the route taken.
