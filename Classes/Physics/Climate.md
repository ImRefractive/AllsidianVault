## What is climate
* Happens in the troposphere
	* Temperature decreases 6.5C every Kilometer you go up
	* The altitude of the troposphere is from 0 to 12/-17KM
* Stratosphere
	* Remains at a constant -60C
	* Upper stratosphere rises to 18C because of the hot ozone layer
	* From 12-50Km
	* It features Jet steams - a horizontal movement of air very strong winds
* Mesosphere
	* -100C
	* coldest region of the atmosphere
	* 50-80KM
	* Protects Earth from meteors via friction
* Thermosphere
	* 2000C so hot it cant be registered on a thermometer
* Broken into two smaller segments
	* Ionosphere 
		* from 80-550KM
		* Ions are present here
		* Responsible for radio communication
	* Exosphere
		* from 550-3200KM
		* Air so thin there is great visibility
		* Satellites orbit there
### Energy Sources and Production
 Electricity is a secondary energy source, and so is hydrogen

### Energy sources
* Specific energy is how much energy in joules you can get per unit mass in kg from a fuel. Its unit are $Jkg^{-1}$ 
* Energy density is how much energy in joules you get per unit volume. Its units are $Jm^{-3}$ 

## Greenhouse gases
Albedo - Genshin Impact character. In physics it refers to how:
*When light strikes an object, some of it is absorbed, and some of it is scattered.
	When light hits a mirror, nearly all of it will be scattered, yet some of it is still absorbed by the mirror.
	If light hits a surface covered with soot, nearly all of it will be absorbed
$$\text{Albedo in terms of scattered and incident power}$$
$$\text{Albedo=} \dfrac{P_{Scattered}}{P_{Incident}}$$
Landforms. vegetation, weather and seasons affect a planet's albedo.
Earth's average albedo is 0.30

The Equations
$$\text{Emissivity} = \dfrac{\text{Power radiated per unit area}}{\delta AT^4}$$

## Greenhouse gases part 2 
* Water vapour contributes the most to the greenhouse effect in our atmosphere
* Most of this water vapour is natural
* The gases that contribute the most in order are
* $H_2O$ 
* $CO_2$
* $N_2O$
* $CH_4$
* $O_3$

## Global Warming Potential
For human induced climate change, the gases all contain various potentials. Not all the gases are equal
$CH_4$ is 23 more effective at heating our atmosphere than $CO_2$
$N_2O$ is 296 times more effective
$CO_2$ is in the atmosphere at far higher rates (400ppm (Parts per million))
*Anthropogenic sources
Meaning originating in human activity
