## What is climate
* Happens in the troposphere
	* Temperature decreases 6.5C every Kilometer you go up
	* The altitude of the troposphere is from 0 to 12/-17KM
* Stratosphere
	* Remains at a constant -60C
	* Upper stratosphere rises to 18C because of the hot ozone layer
	* From 12-50Km
	* It features Jet steams - a horizontal movement of air very strong winds
* Mesosphere
	* -100C
	* coldest region of the atmosphere
	* 50-80KM
	* Protects Earth from meteors via friction
* Thermosphere
	* 2000C so hot it cant be registered on a thermometer
* Broken into two smaller segments
	* Ionosphere 
		* from 80-550KM
		* Ions are present here
		* Responsible for radio communication
	* Exosphere
		* from 550-3200KM
		* Air so thin there is great visibility
		* Satellites orbit there
### Energy Sources and Production
 Electricity is a secondary energy source, and so is hydrogen

### Energy sources
* Specific energy is how much energy in joules you can get per unit mass in kg from a fuel. Its unit are $Jkg^{-1}$ 
* Energy density is how much energy in joules you get per unit volume. Its units are $Jm^{-3}$
