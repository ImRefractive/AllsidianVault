* Important things $$PV=nRT$$
$$Work is mad! F \cdot ma \cdot d$$
$$\text{Work Is Also} = \frac{F}A \cdot D$$
* Distance for an ideal gas is Volume 
* When pressure is constant its called isobaric
	* Iso for same, baric for pressure
* Work is $P\cdot\Delta V$
* Isovolumetric is when pressure and temperature changes but the volume remain constant. 
	* An example is when the temperature of a container rises, and the gas's pressure therefore also rises, but the volume of the container stays the same.
	* Isovolumetric can also be called isochoric
* Isothermal is when you compress the volume of the container, the pressure rises, and the volume decreases, and if done slow enough, the temperature doesn't change
* adiabatic is when no heat is transferred into or out of the system, but work done on or by the system will eventually lead to changes in its temperature, without any of this temperature change coming from the environment. 
## Actual Thermodynamic Cycles part
	We us
	
	e graphs to sketch the outcome of changes in gas thermodynamics - eg. isobaric, isocharic, isothermic conditions in one graph 
	A fixed quantity of a gas undergoes a cyce by changing between the following three states:
	State A (p = 2Pa, V = $10m^3$)
	State B (p = 8Pa, V = 10m^3)
	State C (p = 8Pa, V = 25^3)
