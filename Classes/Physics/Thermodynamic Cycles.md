* Important things $$PV=nRT$$
$$Work is mad! F \cdot ma \cdot d$$
$$\text{Work Is Also} = \frac{F}A \cdot D$$
* Distance for an ideal gas is Volume 
* When pressure is constant its called isobaric
	* Iso for same, baric for pressure
* Work is $P\cdot\Delta V$
* Isovolumetric is when pressure and temperature changes but the volume remain constant. 
	* An example is when the temperature of a container rises, and the gas's pressure therefore also rises, but the volume of the container stays the same.
	* Isovolumetric can also be called isochoric
* Isothermal is when you compress the volume of the container, the pressure rises, and the volume decreases, and if done slow enough, the temperature doesn't change
* adiabatic is when no heat is transferred into or out of the system, but work done on or by the system will eventually lead to changes in its temperature, without any of this temperature change coming from the environment. 
## Actual Thermodynamic Cycles part
	We use graphs to sketch the outcome of changes in gas thermodynamics - eg. isobaric, isocharic, isothermic conditions in one graph 
	A fixed quantity of a gas undergoes a cyce by changing between the following three states:
	State A (p = 2Pa, V = $10m^3$)
	State B (p = 8Pa, V = 10m^3)
	State C (p = 8Pa, V = 25^3)

## Laws of thermodynamics 
* Zeroeth Law - IF cup A and cup B have reached thermal equilibrium, and Cup A and Cup C have also reached thermal equilibrium, Cup B and Cup C have reached thermal equilibrium 
* First Law - Energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system. The total energy of the system is constant. 
$$Q = \Delta U + W$$
* Second Law - The entropy of any isolated system always increases. Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder location to a hotter location. 
* Third law - The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero. 

## Gas and that 
* A positive W suggests work is done on the gas
* A negative W suggests that Work is done by the gas
* When work is done by a system, the work done takes away from the internal energy of the system

$$\Delta U = Q+W$$
* $\Delta$U is the change in internal energy U of the system 
* Q is the net heat transferred into the system - that is, Q is the sum of all heat transfer into and out of the system 
* W is
