Explain, In terms of the energy of its molecules, why the temperature of a pure substance does not change during melting.
	During melting, the temperature does not change because;  the energy that would ordinarily be released as head is instead being used to reconfigure the structure of the substance atomically.
Define Thermal capacity.
	The amount of heat energy required to heat up the substance by one degree 
J/Temperature/mass
$$Specific~heat~capacity= J\T(Celcius/Kelvin)*M(mass)$$
