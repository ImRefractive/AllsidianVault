What is it trying to say?
	It tells us that hotter objects will radiate more energy than cooler ones and that energy output increases rapidly with temperature, as indicated by the temperature being raised to the fourth power.

$$P = e\sigma AT^4$$
## Black-Body Radiation
* Solids can absorb many more wavelengths than the atmospheric gases
* Depending on the colour of a solid you can determine what wavelengths it cannot absorb 
* For example, a green object reflects (and therefore does not absorb) green light.
* White objects appear white because they reflect all colours. Black objects absorb all colours so no light is reflected
A black-body absorbs all wavelengths, as it heats up, it emits all wavelengths. This is called black body radiation 
	The nature of the emitted radiation depends on three parameters
	1. Absolute temperature, T in Kelvin
	2. Surface area, A 
	3. Emissivity, e (a constant of sorts)
		Perfect emissivity of 1 means that:
		1. is a black-body
		2. Is in equilibrium with its surroundings (it emits and absorbs radiant energy at the same rate)
		3. radiates energy that is characteristic of its temperature
* Solids can be heated to incandescence (Glowing) and different visible radiation.
* If we heat a black body to incandescence we observe:
	* The higher the temperature the greater the intensity at all wavelengths
	* The higher temperature the smaller the wavelength of the maximum intensity
## Wien's displacement Law
This law tells us that the wavelength of the maximum intensity $\lambda_{max}$ for blackbodies at temperature T in kelvin 
$$ \lambda_{max}=2.90*10^{-3}/T $$
