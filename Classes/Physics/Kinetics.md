Boltzmann
$$E_k = \frac{3}2k_BT$$
The equation represents the average kinetic energy of a particle in an ideal gas where k_B is the boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in kelvin
* The Boltzmann constant is $k_B$ $$1.38  10^{-23} JK^{-1}$$
* Atomic Mass units can be converted into KG
	* The conversion factor is $$1.660539 \cdot 10^{-27}kg$$
