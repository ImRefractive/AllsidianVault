Conduction (For Solids)
	Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance
	So a substance with a high temperature is able to give some of that energy to the particles next to it and so on
	This only works in a solid and thermal energy always moves from high to low energy
	- Fourier's Law of Heat Conduction
	- $\Delta$Q/ $\Delta$t: Rate of heat transfer(energy per unit time)
	- \frac{$\Delta$Q}{$\Delta$t}

Convection (For liquids)
	Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance
	So a substance with a high temperature is able to give some of the energy to the particles next to it and so on.
Radiation 
	- Has no real temperature
	- is the movement of electromagnetic waves through a vacuum
High K vs Low K
	Materials with a high K value are good conductors of heat 
	Heat energy moves rapidly through such materials
	Metals like copper and silver have high k values
	High k materials are used where efficient heat transfer is needed, such as in cookware radiators and thermal heat sinks
